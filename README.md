# Hi there 👋 I'm Sabrina

I'm currently studying at 42 São Paulo and learning programming, mainly in C and C++.  
Most of the projects here are part of the 42 curriculum.

🛠️ Some projects I worked on:

- **So Long**: A small 2D game where the player collects items and finds the exit. It uses a simple graphics library (MiniLibX) and handles basic game logic, rendering, and user input.
- **Philosophers**: An implementation of the Dining Philosophers problem using threads and mutexes to explore concurrency and synchronization.
- **Minishell**: A simple Unix shell written in C. It handles parsing commands, executing them, dealing with environment variables, pipes, and redirections.
- **Cub3d**: A basic first-person view game using raycasting (similar to early 90s games like Wolfenstein 3D). It involves working with math, textures, and keyboard controls.
